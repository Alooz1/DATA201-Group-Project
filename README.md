# DATA201-Group-Project

Hello! Here you will find Yazeeds, Chaarve and Herans' DATA201 Group Project - In this project we looked into AirBNB Prices around the world using http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/ and tried to see if world population and GDP Per Capita had any relationship with the price of AirBNBs. We acquired the world data from this website https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-by-country/ 

please have a read of documentation.txt as it explains all our files and what they do when being run thank you!
