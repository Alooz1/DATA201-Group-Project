There are several jupyter notebooks in this project. 9 of the jupyter notebooks contain data for AirBNBs and can be run in any order - these are named with either the country or cities name that had the AirBNB data scraped from.

PriceDistributionIn9Country.ipynb has all countries combined in one notebook so a price distribution box plot comparing all countries could be created.
  
WorldData.ipynb contains all countries populations, GDP per capita and country names.

Other pdf files are either our project report, group diary or group presentation.
